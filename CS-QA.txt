Q:Python: What is the GIL?
A:It's the Global Interpreter Lock. It's is a part of CPython. It ensures only one thread runs in the interpreter at once. Having the GIL simplifies many low-level details (memory management, callouts to C extensions, etc.)

Q:Python: When is the GIL released?
A:During I/O (disk IO, network IO, output to display) including when a thread uses sleep.

Q:Python: What is a "tick" in CPython?
A:Approximately 1 machine instruction.

Q:Python: What happens every 100 "ticks" in the CPython interpreter?
A:A thread check occurs during which the thread releases the GIL then attempts to reacquire it. Other Python threads will contend for the the GIL. This is no longer the case in 3.4.

Q:Python: What is a lock in CPython?
A:It's a binary semaphore. It's not a mutex lock.

Q:What is internal memory?
A:Main memory or core memory.

A:6

Q:What is the min and max compression settings in command line gzip?

Q:What is a process?
A:An instance of an executing program consisting of <br/>an address space and one or more threads of control. <br/>It has restricted rights. <br/>It owns a region of memory. </br>It owns file descriptors, file system context. <br/>It encapsulates one or more threads sharing the process' resources. <br/>It is isolated from other processes.

Q:What is a context switch?
A:The copying out and in of register state to switch from running one process to running another.

Q:What is the scheduler?
A:The scheduler manages the priorities of user and OS processes.

Q:What causes operating systems to crash most of the time?
A:Device drivers. They are in the kernel and very low level. They have access to all the hardware, including memory. They are written by authors outside of the operating system.
